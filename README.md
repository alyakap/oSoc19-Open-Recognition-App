# [Open Recognition](https://lets.opentrust.be) (oSoc 2019)
Being expat, immigrant, student or refugee is quite troublesome especially when it comes to be recognized in a new place. Getting hired, rent an apartment, find a scholarship, basically trying to gain people trusts without a local network is the most difficult part of a settlement. 

Open Recognition is **social network** that helps newcomers to get recognition that they need to be part of community. The purpose of the app is helping users to collect trust statements, endorsements from other people. 

Open Recognition is **open-source** project that was one of the projects in [Open Summer of Code](https://2019.summerofcode.be/2019/open-recognition) which is a 4-week summer programme in July. The goal: provide network and support necessary to transform open source/innovation projects into powerful real-world services.
